          Hi! My name is Alexander Hsieh. I'm fifteen years old and have been playing music ever since I was five, though I'm nearing my fourth year of playing the oboe. I would consider music my biggest hobby, and as such is something that I both really enjoy listening to and playing. Over my years playing oboe, I've participated in many different ensembles and music groups including Greenwood Music Camp, Pasadena Youth Symphony Orchestra, Colburn Sinfonietta, and all state groups like CBDA and SCSBOA. To me, the most enjoyable aspect of music is the teamwork aspect, so I'd like to end off this little remark by thanking fellow music loving students and teachers alike for making music such a fun activity!

        <p class="bio bio-short">
          My name is Rio Navarro. I'm 15 years old and a student at La Cañada High School. I play both the cello and the accordion, and what I love most about music is the sense of community. It truly feels like a place where I belong. Some of my musical accomplishments include performing for guests at the Pasadena Playhouse Gala, the Playhouse Party, winning the All-Ireland Championship title for accordion, receiving the Cotati student scholarship, and earning first place at the Dan Stover Memorial competition. In addition to music, I’m a competitive Irish dancer. Every St. Patrick’s Day for the past 10 years, I’ve performed right here at Villa Gardens with Cleary Irish Dance. Outside of music and dance, I’m an avid outdoors enthusiast, a speedcuber, and I aspire to become either a commercial airline pilot or work for NASA someday. I'm so excited to share my music with you!

        <p class="bio bio-short">
          Hello! My name is Joanne Turner, and my instrument is my voice. I’m a classically trained soprano with a range of F♯3 to G7. While I specialize in both choral and musical theater singing, I consider myself strongest as a choral vocalist. I have spent over five years as a member of the Grammy Award-winning Los Angeles Children’s Chorus (LACC), an experience that shaped my vocal technique and musical discipline. I’ve also performed in musical theater for more than seven years, playing lead roles in nine different productions. These opportunities taught me the importance of collaboration as well as how to shine as an individual. In 2023, my training and experience led to me being signed by a talent agent. A few months later, I was selected as a soprano for the 2024 SCVA Junior Honor Choir, an experience that fully opened my eyes to the beauty of choral singing. More recently, I was chosen from over 6,000 applicants to join the 2025 ACDA 8–10 Treble National Honor Choir. Being a part of this choir was an incredibly unique experience. While most other choristers had friends from their own schools participating, most students at my school had no idea that honor choirs existed. Despite my initial reservations, over the course of the three rehearsal dates, I bonded with my peers over our shared love of music, and our choir was able to take some of the most challenging pieces and turn them into passionate works of art. These choirs provided me the opportunity to elevate my vocal technique and musical expression, and also connected me with world-class conductors, educators, and peers from across the country. Throughout middle school, I was a three-year soloist for the SPMS choral music program. I performed in and helped select members for our annual Valentines Singing Grams, and created the school’s choral music library. I also had the honor of singing the National Anthem at our promotion ceremony. More recently, I mentored the Preparatory Choir at LACC and performed a duet at their Spring Showcase. I continue to support the SPMS choral program by volunteering at rehearsals and concerts, including curating the music slideshow and helping with logistics. In addition to performing, I run a music account on Instagram where I post covers of songs I enjoy or that are requested by my followers. If you'd like to connect or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me at @joannelturner2028@gmail.com, or on Instagram at @music_by_leia (https://www.instagram.com/music_by_leia).

        <p class="bio bio-short">
          Jeremy Chen, has been playing the violin since he was 5 years old. Music has given him the chance to grow, connect with others, and share something he really cares about.

He has had the opportunity to perform at Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall, which was an unforgettable experience. He also placed second a few times in the Open Division at the Satori competition, and has been lucky to take part in many festivals through the Glendale branch of MTAC.

Through all of these experiences, he has learned that music isn’t just about performing — it’s about the dedication behind the practice, the friendships made along the way, and the joy of sharing music with others. Outside of perofrming music, Jeremy likes to play tennis and hang out with friends.
